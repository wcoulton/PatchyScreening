Routines for computing stacked patchy screening profiles
=================

This library contains a set of routines used to produce stacked 1D and 2D patchy screening profiles.
See `this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13033 />`_ for details of the alogrithm. 


This code requires the following libraries:
numpy
scipy
tqdm
